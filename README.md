To display your site online, use GitHub Pages:

    Go to your repository page.

    Go to the Settings section.

    Go to the GitHub Pages section and set the Source to the main branch.

    Now your site will be available at: https://username.github.io/repository-name

### Step 5: View Your Static Website

After the above settings, you can view your resume online. This site is set up without any complex servers and uses only static files to display content.

### Step 6: Further Personalization

You can further personalize this site:

    Use CSS to change the appearance of your site.

    Add HTML to include more sections in your resume.

    Use GitHub Actions to automatically publish changes.
